#### Description:
This project is a website that teaches 4 different probability problems. This was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Graphs in the Target Practice and Monty Hall Problems were built using the ChartJs Library. 
Within the Monty Hall Problem, users can play rounds over and over of the game, where they choose one door, and then have the option to stay or switch.
 With the birthday problem, users can change the number of people in a room and see how this affects the probability that at least two share a birthday.
 The Letter Scramble module lets users see the possible combinations and formula to follow if they would like to compute the number of ways of ordering letters in a given word.
In the Target Practice module, users can randomly place points on a dartboard and the program will use the number of points that fall in the inner circle to estimate the value of Pi.
