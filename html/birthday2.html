      <p>
        Let's assume that the chance of having a birthday on a certain day is equal for every day of the year. 
        How many people need to enter a room before the probability that two individuals share a birthday is less than 50%? 
        Read the explanations below and the interactive slider provided to find out.

        The Case for 2 People
      </p>
      <div class="instruction"><p> If there is only 1 person in the room, the birthday problem is trivial. There is a 0% chance of two people sharing
        a birthday since there is only 1 person. </p>
      <p> If there are only 2 people in the room, the problem is still simple.
        The probability that the 2 people share a birthday is <span class="lead"> 1&frasl;365 </span>
        as the second person in the room has a 1 out of 365 chance of being
        born on the same day as the first person.

       A Case of 3 People

    <div class="instruction">
     <p> Imagine Ashley, Bob, and Charlie enter the room in that order. </p>
    <p> How do we figure out the probability that at least two of them share a birthday? 
    </p>
    <p> We can first add the probability that each pair of people share a birthday.</p>
    <p>
      But wait! if we do that, then we also have to account for the fact that adding in this
       way means that we added the probability of all 3 sharing a birthday three times,
        so we must subtract out that probability.
    </p>
    <p> Rather complicated right? Let's move to the generalized solution to see how we can make this problem easier.</p>

       The Generalized Case  </p>
       <div class="instruction">
       <p> As you can see with the case of three people, this problem becomes rather difficult quickly if 
        we don't find a simpler way to approach it. </p>
      <p>Instead of trying to find the probabilities of any given two people sharing a birthday, we can use
        a trick of probability to simplify. Instead, consider the probability that no two people in the room share a birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this mean? If no two people share a birthday, that means that everyone in the room has a distinct birthday.
        While this is the opposite of what we are trying to find, we can use the fact that 1 minus the probability
        of an event not happening is equal to the event happening. Look below to see how this applies to the case of N people.

         <p> Use the slider below to change the number of individuals in the room and see how the equation and the probability that at least two people in the room share a birthday. 
        </p>
        <p>Try to find the lowest number of people in a room such that the probability that at least two individuals share a birthday is at least 50%. Is this number lower or higher than expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be warned that although the probability may show 100% for higher values, using the equation as written out, you can see that the value will not be truly 0 until there are at least 366 people in the room. This is because unless there are 366 individuals in the room, there is a chance that all individuals have different birthdays, though this probability gets smaller and smaller with each person added to the room.
