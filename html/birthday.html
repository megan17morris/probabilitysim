          <h1>Welcome to the Birthday Problem!</h1>
          <h4>Problem Introduction</h4>
          <p>The birthday problem relies on a few assumptions.
            Assume that there are 365 days in every year (we are going to ignore leap years),
            and assume that the probability of being born on a given day
            is the same for all days of the year. Thus, with this assumption you have a <span class="lead"> 1&frasl;365 </span>chance of 
            being born on July 2nd, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using these assumptions, the birthday problem asks
            what is the minimum number of people that must be in a room
            such that it is more likely than not that two people in the room share a birthday.
          </p>

          The Case for Two People
        </h4>
        <p> If there is only 1 person in the room, the birthday problem is trivial. There is a 0% chance of two people sharing
          a birthday since there is only 1 person. </p>
        <p> If there are only 2 people in the room, the problem is still simple.
          The probability that the 2 people share a birthday is <span class="lead"> 1&frasl;365 </span>
          as the second person in the room has a 1 out of 365 chance of being
          born on the same day as the first person.

            P(The 2 people share a birthday)  = $$ 1 * \frac{1}{365} = \frac{1}{365} $$

          The Case for Three People
        </h4>
        <p> Imagine Ashley, Bob, and Charlie enter the room in that order. </p>
        <p> How do we figure out the probability that at least two of them share a birthday? 
        </p>
        <p> We can first add the probability that each pair of people share a birthday.</p>
        <p>
          But wait! if we do that, then we also have to account for the fact that adding in this
           way means that we added the probability of all 3 sharing a birthday three times,
            so we must subtract out that probability.
        </p>
        <p> Rather complicated right? Let's move to the generalized solution to see how we can make this problem easier.</p>
        <div class="math-container text-center">
          <h3>3 People</h3>
          <p>
            P(At least 2 out of 3 share a birthday)  = 
          </p>
          <p>P(A & B) + P(B & C) + P(A & C) - 2 &#215 P(A & B & C) =</p>
          <p>$$\frac{1}{365} + \frac{1}{365} + \frac{1}{365} - 2((\frac{1}{365})^{2})$$</p>

          The Generalized Case
        </h4>
        <p> As you can see with the case of three people, this problem becomes rather difficult quickly if 
          we don't find a simpler way to approach it. </p>
        <p>Instead of trying to find the probabilities of any given two people sharing a birthday, we can use
          a trick of probability to simplify. Instead, consider the probability that no two people in the room share a birthday.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does this mean? If no two people share a birthday, that means that everyone in the room has a distinct birthday.
          While this is the opposite of what we are trying to find, we can use the fact that 1 minus the probability
          of an event not happening is equal to the event happening. Look below to see how this applies to the case of N people.
        </p>
        <div class="math-container">
          <h3>N people</h3>
          <p>
            1 - P(No one shares a birthday) = <span class=""> $$ 1 - (1 * \frac{364}{365}  * ... 
              \frac{365 - (n-1)}{365} )
